# TRACKING_SYSTEM_PROJECT
This project involves developing a system using the TM4C123G LaunchPad that tracks the distance a user travels between two points using GPS coordinates. The system will also provide visual feedback to the user using built-in LEDs, indicating when they are close to their destination or have reached it.
